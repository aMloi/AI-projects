*Note*: Additional projects are included in the repository. Check individual project directories for details. Feel free to update this section with specific project names and descriptions.

## Setup

To run the projects in this repository, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the necessary dependencies. Most projects are developed in Python 3.8 or higher and may require specific libraries.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Optional: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for running notebook-based projects

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
   cd [your-repo-name]
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install common dependencies (specific projects may require additional libraries):
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow==2.17.0 numpy==1.24.3 scikit-learn==1.5.1 matplotlib==3.9.2
   ```
4. Check individual project READMEs for project-specific setup instructions.

## Usage

Each project is self-contained in its own directory. To use a project:
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```
2. Read the project's `README.md` for specific instructions on running the code, including:
   - Required dependencies.
   - Dataset setup (if applicable).
   - Running scripts or notebooks.
3. Example for running a Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook [notebook-name].ipynb
   ```
4. For Google Colab-based projects, upload the notebook to Colab and follow the instructions in the notebook.
